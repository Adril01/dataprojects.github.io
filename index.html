									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/istockphoto-1138429558-612x612.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>MEKKO Retail Inc. is a global retail chain with multiple departments ranging from Books to Automotive. With its vast presence in different countries, it serves millions of customers daily. As the company expands, it's becoming increasingly challenging for the management to keep track of
										customer demographics, preferences, and other vital details that can help in improving sales and customer satisfaction. The raw data makes it difficult to draw insights and make strategic decisions, leading to missed opportunities. We leveraged an interactive dashboard in Excel to visualize the data and help the management easily spottrends, understand customer preferences based on demographics, and make informed decisions. </p>
